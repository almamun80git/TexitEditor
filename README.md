# TexitEditor

TexitEditor is a lightweight text editing application written in Python. It aims to provide a simple, extensible, and scriptable environment for quick note‑taking, code snippets, and general plain-text authoring.

> NOTE: This README is a documentation draft based on limited repository content. Please adjust sections (e.g., features, roadmap, architecture) to reflect the actual implementation once source files are added.

---

## Key Features (Planned / Proposed)

- Fast startup with minimal dependencies
- Multi-document editing (tabbed or windowed)
- Basic editing actions: open, save, save as, undo/redo, find/replace
- Syntax highlighting (via Pygments or Tkinter `Text` tags) for common languages
- Configurable font, themes (light/dark), and line numbers
- Auto-detect file encoding (UTF-8 fallback)
- Recent files list
- Pluggable extensions (simple Python hooks)
- Optional spell checking (e.g., via `pyenchant`)
- Cross-platform (Windows / Linux / macOS)

## Architecture Overview (Proposed)

| Layer | Responsibility | Example Components |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|
| UI Layer | Rendering windows, menus, dialogs | Tkinter / PyQt widgets |
| Editor Core | Buffer management, undo stack | `editor/buffer.py` |
| Services | File I/O, encoding detection, settings | `services/files.py`, `services/settings.py` |
| Extensions | User-provided enhancements | `extensions/` |
| Utilities | Logging, helpers | `utils/` |

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (recommend latest stable)
- (If GUI uses Tkinter) Tk libraries (bundled with most Python distributions)
- (Optional) Virtual environment

### Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/almamun80git/TexitEditor.git
cd TexitEditor
```

### Create Virtual Environment (Optional)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
(Adjust once `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` exists.)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using `pyproject.toml` (Poetry):
```bash
poetry install
```

---

## Running

```bash
python -m texiteditor
```

Or if an entry script exists:
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Configuration

Planned configuration hierarchy (override order: later wins):

1. Default internal settings
2. User config file (e.g., `~/.config/texiteditor/config.toml` or `%APPDATA%\TexitEditor\config.toml`)
3. Command-line flags (e.g., `--theme dark --font "Fira Code 12"`)

Example (proposed) `config.toml`:
```toml
theme = "dark"
font_family = "Fira Code"
font_size = 13
show_line_numbers = true
```

---

## Command-Line Options (Proposed)

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--file <path>` | Open a file on launch |
| `--theme <name>` | Force a theme |
| `--encoding <enc>` | Specify file encoding |
| `--readonly` | Open in read-only mode |

---

## Extension System (Planned Concept)

Extensions could be simple Python files placed in `extensions/` implementing a `register(app)` function:

```python
def register(app):
    app.menu.add_item("Tools", "Sort Lines", lambda: sort_current_buffer(app))
```

Security note: Only load trusted extensions.

---

## Testing

(Adjust once tests exist.)

```bash
pytest -q
```

Continuous integration can be added with a workflow file:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

---

## Roadmap (Initial Draft)

| Milestone | Goals |
|-----------|-------|
| v0.1 | Basic open/save/edit, minimal UI |
| v0.2 | Find/replace, recent files |
| v0.3 | Syntax highlighting, themes |
| v0.4 | Extensions API v1 |
| v1.0 | Stable API, packaging, documentation |

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`feat/short-description`)
3. Write clear commits
4. Include/update tests when possible
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

Coding style: Follow PEP 8 (use `ruff` or `flake8` + `black`).

## Logging (Proposed)

Basic logging using Python’s `logging` module:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("texiteditor")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

---

## Internationalization (Future Consideration)

- Extract UI strings
- Provide `.po` / `.mo` files
- Allow language override via CLI/env

---

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy-load large files
- Avoid full-text re-highlighting on each keystroke (use region diffing)
- Debounce expensive operations (spell check, indexing)

---

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize paths (avoid directory traversal in future plugin loading)
- Optional sandbox or permission prompts for extensions performing I/O

---

## License

Specify a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). Add a `LICENSE` file.

---

## Attribution

Developed by the TexitEditor project maintainers.

---

## FAQ (Draft)

**Q: Why another text editor?**  
A: Educational and customizable foundation for Python-based GUI tooling.

**Q: Will there be plugin isolation?**  
A: Initial versions likely trust local Python code; future versions may add isolation boundaries.

**Q: Does it support large files?**  
A: Planned optimizations; early versions may struggle with very large (>10MB) files.

---

## Status

This is an early-stage project; core implementation details may change significantly.

---

## Changelog (To Begin After First Release)

Create `CHANGELOG.md` following Keep a Changelog format once versions are tagged.

---

## Inspiration

- Simplicity of Notepad
- Extensibility of lightweight scriptable editors
